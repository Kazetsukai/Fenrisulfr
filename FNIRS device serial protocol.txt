					---------Serial protocol for FNIRS device---------

-----Turn on/off specific LED:-----

<'L'><LED_STATE:BYTEH ADDRx><BYTEL ADDRx>

Details:
	<'L'> is hex 0x4C.	
	:BYTEH ADDR><BYTEL ADDR> are the upper and lower address bytes of the LED (16 bit address). The first bit of :BYTEH ADDR> contains the LED state.
	<LED_STATE: is highest bit of first byte after, can be 0 or 1 (turn off LED and turn on LED respectively).

Device will send acknowledgement after completing the LED state change by returning the command 'L' (0x4C) to the PC.

Example:
	To turn on LED at address 3, the following command is sent to the device:
	4C 00 03 01

	To turn off LED at address 2, the following command is sent to the device:
	4C 00 02 00 



-----Get sensor reading:-----

<'S'><BYTEH ADDR><BYTEL ADDR>

Details:
	<'S'> is hex 0x53.
	<BYTEH ADDR><BYTEL ADDR> are the upper and lower address bytes of the sensor to be read (16 bit address).	

Example:
	To get sensor reading from sensor number 24, the following command is sent to the device:
	53 00 18		(note 24 is hex 0x0018)
	
	Device will respond by taking a reading from sensor, and will then send to PC:
	<'S'><BYTEH DATA><BYTEL DATA>
	e.g, 53 02 8C

-----Set ADC Config:-----

<'A'><VREF:PRESCALER>

Details:
	<'A'> is hex 0x41.
	<VREF: Upper 4 bits of <VREF:PRESCALER> byte. Can be 0x00 or 0x01. If 0x00, then ADC ref voltage is set to 1.1V. If 0x01, then ADC ref voltage is set to 5.0V. 
	       Setting to 1.1V will give better accuracy for small signals, but will clip when the signal gets too high. (think of it like a zoom in/out kind of thing).
	
	:PRESCALER> Lower 4 bits of <VREF:PRESCALER> byte. Sets division factor between system clock frequency and input clock to the ADC. Must be a value 'n' such that 1 < n < 7. (prescaler factor is then 2^n)	    		    Larger values mean ADC takes longer to get reading, but this may help reduce noise.

Example:
	To set ADC to use vref 5V and prescaler number 6 (64 factor), computer sends:
	41 86

	Device will respond by sending <'A'> back to computer.
